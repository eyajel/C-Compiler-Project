# C Language Compiler

Welcome to the C Language Compiler repository! This project is a compiler for the C programming language, incorporating semantic analysis, lexical analysis, and syntax analysis.

## Compiler Components

1. **Lexical Analysis:**
   - Tokenization of input C source code.
   - Identification and classification of tokens.
   - Generation of a token stream.

2. **Syntax Analysis:**
   - Parsing the token stream to create a syntax tree.
   - Verification of the syntactic structure of the C code.
   - Identification of syntax errors.

3. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - Analyzing the meaning of the code beyond its structure.
   - Verification of semantic correctness.
   - Identification of semantic errors.
